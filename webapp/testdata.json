In most applications, individual cells are used as the information processing unit. However, single cell engineering is limited by the necessary molecular complexity and the accompanying metabolic burden of synthetic circuits. To overcome these limitations, synthetic biologists have begun engineering multicellular systems that combine cells with designed subfunctions. To further advance information processing in synthetic multicellular systems, we introduce the application of reservoir computing. Reservoir computers (RCs) approximate a temporal signal processing task via a fixed-rule dynamic network (the reservoir) with a regression-based readout. Importantly, RCs eliminate the need of network rewiring, as different tasks can be approximated with the same reservoir.
