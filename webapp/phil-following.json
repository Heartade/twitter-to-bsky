In most applications, individual cells are used as the information processing unit. However, single cell engineering is limited by the necessary molecular complexity and the accompanying metabolic burden of synthetic circuits. To overcome these limitations, synthetic biologists have begun engineering multicellular systems that combine cells with designed subfunctions. To further advance information processing in synthetic multicellular systems, we introduce the application of reservoir computing. Reservoir computers (RCs) approximate a temporal signal processing task via a fixed-rule dynamic network (the reservoir) with a regression-based readout. Importantly, RCs eliminate the need of network rewiring, as different tasks can be approximated with the same reservoir.

The thought experiment uses water-based logic gates to construct a computer in a way that permits cleanly slicing each gate and connection in half, creating two identical computers each instantiating the same computation. The slicing can be reversed and repeated via an on/off switch, without changing the amount of matter in the system. The question is what do different computational theories of consciousness believe is happening to the number and nature of individual conscious units as this switch is toggled. Under a token interpretation, there are now two discrete conscious entities; under a type interpretation, there may remain only one. Both interpretations lead to different implications depending on the adopted theoretical stance.
